# Feedback Loop

## Description

Duration: 2-Week Sprint

The purpose of this application is to gather feedback from users about their experience with a particular product or service. This application, in a sense, acts as a survey form, allowing the user the ability to provide their feelings, understanding, level of support, and any additional comments they have about the product or service. I think this application would be a valuable implementation for big companies and businesses so that services and products can continuously improve to ensure their users/customers are satisfied with their services.
